 please click [here]() for more insight on my contribution to this project

# Summary
  Spice It is a recipe finder that dynamically creates recipe cards from TheMealDB and AmazonFresh to give the user a fresh dish to cook for any occasion. The user just simply has to search for a keyword or a dish name in the search bar and let Spice it do the rest. After finding the perfect meal, you can order all the ingredients you need through AmazonFresh.
